# Snake-game-in-Python

This repository contains the code for Snake game made using Python programming language.
I have used "Turtle" library in Python to make the basic graphic interface and the framework of the game.
Obeject Oriented Programming is used to make the code simpler and easier to identify the errors and edit the code.
